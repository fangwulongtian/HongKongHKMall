					<div class="help_bt">Ⅳ About Full Money Back</div>
					<div class="help_bt">1. What's Full Money Back?</div>
					<div class="help_nr">Full Money Back means that the money you've spent on Huika Mall will be 100% returned in Huimi (a virtual currency on Huika Mall) to your Huika account day by day until all is returned. </div>
					<div class="help_bt">2. When will the full money back reward start? </div>
					<div class="help_nr">The date of money return for all products will be clearly indicated before your every purchase. </div>
					<div class="help_bt">3. How is full money back reward calculated? </div>
					<div class="help_nr">Member will get 100% of consumption amount rebates in Huimi for every purchase on Huika Mall. The Huimi rebates a member receives per day during the event will be the order amount (excluding shipping fees) multiplied by 100% and divided by 1,500 (days). Full Money Back reward is calculated for one single order at a time; the amount of rebates per day reserves 2 digits after the decimal point (rounded) and the shortage will be reimbursed on the final rebate day to ensure 100% Huimi reward back to member as promised.【Full Money Back reward starts 7 days upon confirmation of goods received. Huika promises each purchase you make on Huika Mall will earn you 100% Huimi rebates on every dollar you spend but does not commit to the specific end date of full money back to member; the Huimi rebates a member receives per day will be calculated based on 1,500 days during the event.】 					
						<p>Rules for Full Money Back:</p>
						<p>Computational formula: Rebates per day (excluding shipping fees) = Total rebates ÷ Rebate days </p>
						<p>Start date: Full Money Back reward starts 7 days upon confirmation of goods received.</p>
						<p>End date: Full Money Back reward ends upon the amount of rebates up to total rebates.</p>
						<p>Method: All the rebates go to your Huika account. </p>
						<p>Goods return rule: In case of return failure, you will also receive the Full Money Back reward for the product you want to return. </p>
